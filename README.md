# Rails Learning Projects

A collection of Ruby on Rails projects built while learning from books, courses, and hands-on practice.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository contains various small and medium-sized Rails applications I developed while studying Ruby on Rails.  
Each project comes from a specific source—such as books, tutorials, online courses, or personal experiments—and represents part of my learning journey.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Practice core Rails concepts
- Experiment with models, controllers, views, and ActiveRecord
- Build real features and small apps
- Track progress and consolidate knowledge
- Serve as a reference for future projects

---

Each project folder contains its own dependencies and setup instructions. 

## 📖 Sources Used

- Books (e.g. Agile Web Development with Rails, The Rails Way)
- Online courses (Udemy, GoRails, etc.)
- Official Rails guides
- Personal experimentation
